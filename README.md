>**Inti** is the ancient Incan God, the [single source of all truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Source_of_Truth).

Inti is the first networking library with persistency in it's core, strongly inspired on frameworks that encourage convention over configuration, Inti aims to provide the simplest, fastest and most reliable networking library.

Inti aims to provide full support for:

* Core Data Model auto-generated networking calls, we use entities and their relationships to figure out your endpoints (routes)
* Full offline support, if your request is made offline, it will get replayed as soon as the device gets access to internet
* Additional layer of security and concurrency over Core Data, POSTs, PUTs and PATCHs couldn't be more secure
