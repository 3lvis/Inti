>**Inti**: Ancient Incan God, the [single source of all truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Source_of_Truth).

Inti is the first networking library with persistency in it's core, strongly inspired on [frameworks](http://rubyonrails.org/) that encourage [convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration), Inti aims to be the simplest, fastest and most reliable networking library.

Inti aims to provide full support for:

* [Core Data Model](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-core_data_modeling_tool/Articles/about_cd_modeling_tool.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010379-CH3-SW1) auto-generated networking methods, we use entities and their relationships to figure out your endpoints (routes)
* Full offline support, if your request is made offline, it will get replayed as soon as the device gets access to internet
* Additional layer of security and concurrency over Core Data, POSTs, PUTs and PATCHs couldn't be more secure
